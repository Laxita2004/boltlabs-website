# User Dashboard Changes

## Overview
The user dashboard has been modified to work without backend integration. All API calls have been replaced with mock data to provide a standalone frontend experience.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **Removed User Routes**: Commented out userRoutes import and route registration in `backend/loader/index.js`
2. **User Controller**: The `userController.js` file is no longer used but kept for reference
3. **User Routes**: The `userRoutes.js` file is no longer used but kept for reference

### Frontend Changes
1. **useUser Hook**: Completely rewritten to use mock data instead of API calls
   - Added mock domains, user profile, and service requests
   - Simulated API delays for realistic user experience
   - All functions now work with local state

2. **API Service**: Commented out userAPI endpoints in `services/api.js`

3. **UserDashboard Component**: 
   - Removed token decoding logic
   - Simplified data fetching
   - Added dynamic status badges for different request states

## Mock Data
- **Domains**: Web Development, Mobile Development, API Integration, Database Design, Cloud Services
- **User Profile**: John Doe (john.doe@example.com)
- **Service Requests**: 3 sample requests with different statuses (Pending, In Progress, Completed)

## Features
The user dashboard now includes:
- ✅ Profile information display
- ✅ New service request creation
- ✅ Request history with status indicators
- ✅ Domain selection dropdown
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the user dashboard
2. View profile information in the Profile tab
3. Create new service requests in the New Request tab
4. View request history in the History tab

All data is now stored locally and will reset on page refresh.
