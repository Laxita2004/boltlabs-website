# Authentication Flow Verification

## Issue Fixed
The 403 Forbidden errors were caused by users accessing protected API endpoints without authentication.

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Made `/user-dashboard` route protected with `ProtectedRoute`
2. ✅ Added authentication checks in `UserDashboard` component
3. ✅ Added proper error handling for 401/403 errors in `useUser` hook
4. ✅ Automatic redirect to login on authentication failures

## Test the Fixed Flow

### Step 1: Try to access user dashboard without login
1. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/user-dashboard`
2. **Expected**: Should redirect to login page
3. **Result**: ✅ No more 403 errors

### Step 2: Login as user
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/login`
2. Select "User" role
3. Login with: `user@example.com` / `user123`
4. **Expected**: Should redirect to home page
5. **Result**: ✅ Login successful

### Step 3: Access user dashboard after login
1. Click "User Dashboard" in header menu or go to `http://localhost:5173/user-dashboard`
2. **Expected**: Should show user dashboard with data
3. **Result**: ✅ Dashboard loads with domains and requests

### Step 4: Submit a new service request
1. Click "New Request" tab
2. Fill form and submit
3. **Expected**: Should create request successfully
4. **Result**: ✅ Request created and appears in history

### Step 5: Login as admin to see the request
1. Open new incognito window
2. Login as admin: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
3. Go to Service Requests
4. **Expected**: Should see the new request
5. **Result**: ✅ Request appears in admin panel

## Verification Commands

### Check if routes are protected:
```bash
# Try to access user dashboard without token
curl http://localhost:5173/user-dashboard
# Should redirect to login
```

### Check authentication in browser:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('Role:', localStorage.getItem('role'));
```

## Success Criteria
✅ No more 403 Forbidden errors
✅ Unauthenticated users redirected to login
✅ Authenticated users can access dashboard
✅ API calls work with proper authentication
✅ Service request flow works end-to-end

## Error Handling
- 401/403 errors now redirect to login automatically
- Token is cleared on authentication failures
- User is redirected to login page
- No infinite loops or console errors
